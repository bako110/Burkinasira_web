# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# You can control the set of applied configuration files using the
# proguardFiles setting in build.gradle.

# For more details, see

# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:
#-keepclassmembers class fqcn.of.javascript.interface.for.webview {
#   public *;
#}

# Uncomment this to preserve the line number information for
# debugging stack traces.
#-keepattributes SourceFile,LineNumberTable

# If you keep the line number information, uncomment this to
# hide the original source file name.
#-renamesourcefileattribute SourceFile

# --- Capacitor core (not shipped as an automatic consumer rule) ---
# Required so R8 keeps the plugin classes/methods the JS bridge calls via
# reflection; without this, native calls silently fail in a release build
# even though everything works fine in a non-minified debug build.
